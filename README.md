# ðŸ”ºWorkflow of the Application
## 1. Role Assignment (Admin Role)
 - Admin logs in and assigns roles to newly created users (default is User).
 - Admin can manage users (add, edit, delete) and their permissions dynamically.
## 2. Transaction Lifecycle (Handled by Accountant, Bursar, and Principal)
### Create Transactions:

 - The Accountant creates income/expense transactions and forwards them in a Pending state to the Bursar.
 - Accountants can edit or delete transactions at this stage.
### Verification (Bursar):

 - The Bursar reviews the pending transactions and either verifies or rejects them.
 - Verified transactions proceed to the Principal; rejected transactions return to the Accountant for correction.
### Approval (Principal):

 - The Principal reviews verified transactions and either approves or rejects them.
 - Approved transactions proceed to the Completed stage.
### Completion (Accountant):

 - The Accountant finalizes approved transactions, marking them as Completed.
 - Rejected transactions return to the Accountant for recreation or further edits.
